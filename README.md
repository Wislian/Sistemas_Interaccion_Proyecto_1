## Objective:
Change the meaning of the trailer without affecting the original video.

## Explanation of the problem:
Choose a trailer for a movie that is going to be released. The goal is to use audacity to edit the sound of the trailer without editing the video.

## Proposed Solution:
We will change the meaning of the trailer for the "smile two", which is originally terror/suspense to something with sense of colombian comedy, thus using music and audio from voice AI generator and videos. For this we will use YouTube to find the audio, narakeet to generate a voice, spleeter to separate the audio and voice of the trailer, convertio to generate the 8-bits format of a song, Y2mate to download the audio, audacity tools to modify and combine the audios and finally, we mashed up all the sounds, voices, and effects using DaVinci Resolve.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, we changed the horror trailer into a comedy trailer, inspired by Colombian humor. We used elements from Boyaca culture, like Carranga music, and the humor of Don Jediondo, a famous Colombian comedian. This made the trailer funnier and showed some of the unique traditions from Boyaca. The changes were:
 - At the beginning of the trailer, the song played during the concert had reverb effects added, phase shifting, bass boost, volume reduction, and a fade-in effect. The girl's voice during her singing also had reverb added to simulate a closed stage environment.
 - The tempo of the girl's voice was adjusted to synchronize with the video.
 - During the trailer, we changed the frequency of the protagonist's voice to a higher pitch to give the effect that something was affecting her.
 - We added various sounds throughout.
 - When the protagonist says "holi," this was the result of changing the pitch. Several sections were isolated to apply fade-in and fade-out effects to avoid abrupt sound transitions. The man's scream was repeated to maintain stability.
 - A bass filter was applied to the background song.
