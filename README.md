## Objective:
Change the meaning of the trailer without affecting the original video.

## Explanation of the problem:
Choose a trailer for a movie that is going to be released. The goal is to use audacity to edit the sound of the trailer without editing the video.

## Proposed Solution:
We will change the meaning of the trailer for the "smile two", which is originally terror/suspense to something with sense of colombian comedy, thus using music and audio from voice AI generator and videos. For this we will use YouTube to find the audio, narakeet to generate a voice, Y2mate to download the audio and audacity tools to modify and combine the audios.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, we changed the horror trailer into a comedy trailer, inspired by Colombian humor. We used elements from Boyaca culture, like Carranga music, and the humor of Don Jediondo, a famous Colombian comedian. This made the trailer funnier and showed some of the unique traditions from Boyaca.
